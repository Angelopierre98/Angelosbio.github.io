        <h1>Angelo Pierre</h1>
        <p><em>AAS Cybersecurity Major and <strong>Web Developer</strong> </em></p>

        <p>Cyber security is one of the newest additions to the tech industry. It is well respected, and high in demand, and many people are intimidated by it. There are problems with that last statement. Something so important is lacking the people
          to fill positions. This is where I come into the picture.
          I, Angelo Pierre, consider myself a tech-savvy individual with many years of experience. Taking a Macintosh class in first grade introduced me to an unforgettable experience. At such a young age, I already knew my favorite operating system
          and possessed a few basic troubleshooting skills. 2019 I bought a MacBook Pro and I instantly felt like I was home again. Having a little supercomputer, I downloaded two different operating systems and let my curiosity get to work. I
          started buying Udemy courses for Web dev, ethical hacking, and python.

        </p>
        <p>
          Later on in the year, I enrolled in West Ga Technical college for an associates in Cybersecurity. Understanding that an associate degree isn’t worth much without any certifications, I began to craft my own curriculum to have a respectable portfolio. An
          internship was something I planned for because I knew experience and certifications are the only way to prove I am competent and can implement what was on the objectives. Getting my A+ was the first step, and now I'm onto the Network+. Once
          I'm done with that I will obtain my security+. After that, I will be attacking a cloud Aws certification, then Blue team level one certification. The list will continue to grow because I understand once you're complacent in this industry,
          you are dead and no longer relevant. I am forever a student and will continue my education until I get my masters in I.T.
